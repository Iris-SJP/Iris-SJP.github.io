Despite the conventional idea that life insurance is primarily meant to protect the
working population’s income, why do so many retired Americans exclusively hold term
life insurance even through old age? Using two surveys of US households, we show
that more than a quarter of Americans over the age of 70 exclusively hold term life
insurance. This pattern is not overly sensitive to changes in work status, the receipt of
Social Security income, or the planned continuation of pension payments to a spouse,
each of which diminishes the need for life insurance to smooth consumption. Given
these demand patterns, we then explore asset and consumption changes around the
time of a spouse’s death. We compare two sets of surviving spouses: one with life
insurance proceeds and one without. We find mixed evidence of consumption effects
and alterations of various objective and subjective indicators of health and well-being.
Beneficiaries seem more likely to spend money on entertainment in the year of death
and for several years after, but they are also more likely to be depressed in the years
that follow, for example.
